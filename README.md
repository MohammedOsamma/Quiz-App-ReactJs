# Getting Started with Create React App
# Interactive Quiz App



# üìù Project Description
This is a simple quiz application where users can answer multiple-choice questions, check their answers, and track their score. The app dynamically updates questions and provides a final result at the end.



# üîß Functions Used 
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ checkAns(e, ans) :

- Checks if the selected answer is correct.
- Updates the score if the answer is correct.
- Highlights the correct or wrong answer.

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ next():

- Moves to the next question.
- Prevents moving forward unless an answer is selected.
- Resets the answer highlights for the new question.

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ reset()

- Resets the quiz to the first question.
- Resets the score and the answer selection state.



# ‚ö° Hooks Used in the Project:
- üîπ useState ‚Üí Manages the quiz state, including the current question, score, and selection lock.
- üîπ useRef ‚Üí References answer options to update their styles dynamically.



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
